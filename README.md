    A simulator for a small simple subset of the MIPS.
    Generate the correspoding mips instructions from 32-bit
    numbers. Run with -r will only output syscall result and 
    error messages.
    Instructions can be simulated:
        add, sub, slt, mul, beq, bne, addi, ori, lui, syscall.
    syscall supports: 
        print integer, exit, print character.
    This program only accept 32-bit valid instrutions.
